/**
 * This file uses the variable droughtInformation which is created and filled from the csv-management.js file. This variable contains the data in data/droughts.csv parsed for JS. Feel free to add, remove and modify functions in this helper.js file.
 * WARNING: You should never change the files droughts.csv nor csv-management.js. If you feel like you need to do so, please talk to your tutors.

/**
 * The rows on the droughtInformation is organized as follows : 
 * Each row contains information relative to one territory + one year
 * All territories are countries, except for the one marked as EU27_2020, corresponding to European Union - 27 countries (from 2020). In the template no information is taken from the EU27_2020 rows but it can be used if necessary.
 * 
 * In each row, there are eight columns. You should not worry about columns 0 to 4 as they do not change throughout the data. You will be interested in reading data from columns 5 to 8. Here is an explanation of what each column does:
 * 
 * [0] eu_sdg (EU Sustainable Development Goals): all are marked as 15_42 (Drought impact on ecosystems in Europe)
 * [1] dimension: always "KM2" (meaning square km)
 * [2] dimension_label: always "Drought impact area"
 * [3] unit: always "KM2" (meaning square km)
 * [4] unit_label: always "Square kilometre"
 * [5] geo (geographic area): This can be EU27_2020 (the whole of the EU) OR a country code (such as ES, FR...)
 * [6] geo_label: A longer version of geo, which will either be "European Union - 27 countries (from 2020)" or the name of the country (such as Spain, France...)
 * [7] time: A number ranging from 2000 to 2023 - representing the year to which that row belongs to
 * [8] obs_value: A number representing the square kilometres of drought observed that year
 * 
 * To access a column, you can use the command droughtInformation[index], for ex. droughtInformation[6] will contain a geo_label.
